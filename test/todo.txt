- Check other intrinsics
- Work early termination intrinsics into for loop with #define
- Check uint_fast! Should make no difference, and help on other systems
- Some flexibility in generating LUT Tables


VARIABLES

- 2D vs 3D
- 32-bit or 64-bit morton codes (go to 128 bit?)

- Benchmarks
-- Linear vs Random

- LUT tables
-- How many precomputed bits
-- Size table
-- difference shifted / pre-shifted?

- Intrinsics usage
