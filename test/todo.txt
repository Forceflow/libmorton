combine enc/decoding on one line

- Cycles time test
- Linear test: start randomly in domain
- Random test: test permutations

- BMI2 instructions, assembly input
- Make calls more templated, this is a mess (see BMI issue)


- early termination methods
- add more LUT sizes (LUT8, for example)
- Better printout, extract to CSV
