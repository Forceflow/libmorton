- Better testing method: specify number of coordinates to test
Random method seems fine now, but for linear, need to pick linear set within domain (middle?)

- Simpler naming scheme for functions
- BMI2
-- Check for AVX on MSVC
-- Implement 2D methods
- Test suite
-- Unroll some loops
-- Do LUT trash test

- Cycles time test
- Linear test: start randomly in domain
- Random test: test permutations

- early termination methods
- add more LUT sizes (LUT8, for example)
- Better printout, extract to CSV
